## Installation

üöÄ

### 1. Download the [download.zip](https://github.com/Gustavo2022003/FileForge/archive/refs/heads/FF-main.zip) file or clone this repository to your computer.

**GitHub CLI:**

```
gh repo clone Gustavo2022003/FileForge
```

**HTTPS:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Gustavo2022003/FileForge.git
```

**SSH:**
```
git@github.com:Gustavo2022003/FileForge.git
```

### 2. Make sure you have PowerShell installed on your system:

To check if PowerShell is installed on your Windows system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open PowerShell**: Press `Win + R` keys to open the "Run" dialog, type "powershell", and press Enter. If PowerShell is installed, a PowerShell window will open.

2. **Check the version**: In PowerShell, you can type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
   ```
   This will display information about the version of PowerShell installed on your system.

3. **Check for the presence of the executable**: You can also check if the PowerShell executable is present on your system. The default path to the PowerShell executable is `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`. You can navigate to this directory in File Explorer and check if the `powershell.exe` file is present.

If PowerShell is installed, you should be able to see its version and start the PowerShell environment without any issues. If it is not installed, you can install the latest version directly from the Microsoft website or through the Windows Store, depending on your version of Windows.

### 3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded/cloned the repository.


### 4. Run the `FF.ps1` script using PowerShell.

To improve the "How to Use" section, we can add more details about each of the available options and provide clearer usage examples. Here's an enhanced version:

## How to Use

üìù To use the project, execute the `FF.ps1` script in PowerShell with the following parameters:

```
.\FF.ps1 <target_directory> <project_name> [-puv] [-mvc] [-py] [-help]
```

You can also specify the options as a string delimited by quotes:

```
.\FF.ps1 <target_directory> <project_name> ["-puv"] ["-mvc"] ["-py"] ["-help"]
```

### Options

‚öôÔ∏è Here are the available options:

| Option  | Description                                                                                                           |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-puv` | Creates the directory and file structure for a project with public, utils, and views directory structure.             |
| `-mvc` | Creates the directory and file structure for a project following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. |
| `-py`  | Creates the directory and file structure for a Python project.                                                         |
| `-help`| Displays the help message with information on how to use the script.                                                    |

Make sure to choose the appropriate option for the type of project you are starting. For example:

```
.\FF.ps1 C:\Projects\MyProject my_project -mvc
```

This command will create the directory and file structure for an MVC project named "my_project" in the directory "C:\Projects\MyProject".

## Types of Structures

FileForge supports different types of directory and file structures, including:

- **PUV**: Structure with directories: public, utils, and views.
- **MVC**: Structure following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern.

## Troubleshooting

üõü If you encounter issues while using FileForge, check the following:

- **PowerShell**: Make sure PowerShell is installed and configured correctly on your system.
- **Permissions**: Verify that you have sufficient permissions to create directories and files in the target directory.
- **Issues**: If you encounter specific errors, refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/Gustavo2022003/FileForge/issues) section or open a new Issue to report the problem.

## Possible Errors and Solutions

During the use of FileForge, you may encounter some common errors. Here are some of the most frequent issues and their corresponding solutions:

### 1. Permission Denied Error When Creating Directory or File

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: You receive an error message indicating that you do not have permission to create a directory or file in the target directory.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Check your user permissions on the operating system. Ensure you have write permissions in the target directory. If running the script in a security-controlled environment, contact the system administrator for assistance.

### 2. Duplicate Project Name

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: You attempt to create a project with a name that already exists in the target directory.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Choose a different name for the project or delete the existing project before attempting to create a new one with the same name. Make sure to check the target directory before creating a new project to avoid name conflicts.

### 3. Error When Running the Script

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: You receive an error when trying to execute the `FF.ps1` script.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Ensure PowerShell is installed correctly on your system and that you are using the correct command to run the script. Also, make sure you are in the correct directory where the script is located. If the issue persists, check for syntax errors in the script or missing dependencies.

### 4. Error When Moving Files

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: The script fails to move some files to their final destinations.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Verify that the target directories are correctly created and that the script has permission to access them. Ensure that file and directory names are correct and that there are no naming conflicts. If necessary, check the write and access permissions on the file system.

### 5. Environment Configuration Issues

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: The script does not function as expected due to incorrect environment settings.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Ensure all necessary environment settings are correctly configured.
